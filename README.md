# Earthquake-Project-CTC

This project is a smart city project that will enable the communication of rescue teams and citizens under the rubble after the earthquake disaster in our country.
This project is currently under development. It will identify the places of the citizens under the debris by marking on the map with the data we receive from wifi, bluetooth and gps, and will also have an interface design that will indicate their health status and will determine the priority and working order for the teams in case of emergency response.
