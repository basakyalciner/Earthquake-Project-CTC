# Earthquake-Project-CTC

This project is a smart city project that will enable the communication of rescue teams 
and citizens under the rubble after the earthquake disaster in our country. This project is 
currently under development. By marking on the map with the data we receive from wifi, bluetooth 
and gps, the places of the citizens who are under the debris will be determined, and they will 
also indicate their health status and determine the priority and working order for the teams 
in case of emergency response.
